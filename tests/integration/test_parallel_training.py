"""
Integration tests for parallel tensor training (Phase 2).

Tests cover:
- JobQueue: Atomic job acquisition, status transitions, error handling
- ParallelTensorTrainer: Concurrent training, collision handling, maturity convergence
- Integration with TensorDatabase from Phase 1

TDD approach: These tests define the expected API behavior.
